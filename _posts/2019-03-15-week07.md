### Updates from Julia

After having succesfully built Julia from source last week, this week marked our first deep dive into learning the language.  As was mentioned in last week's blog post, a few of the resources we covered included [these](http://ucidatascienceinitiative.github.io/IntroToJulia/Html/JuliaMentalModel) [two](http://ucidatascienceinitiative.github.io/IntroToJulia/Html/WhyJulia) articles and this [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h8rQyEpiZA) on Julia.  I thought that the articles would be helpful to cover as they both dicuss the design philosophy and core concepts of the language.  Being that we hope to soon be contributing, I think it is important that we have a solid understanding of the language's foundation.  The video tutorial was a nice comprehensive introduction to Julia, which we will augment with some of the other materials available on the [Julia Learning](https://julialang.org/learning/) webpage.

Aside from covering some of the learning materials, we have spent some more time going over possible issues to work on. One of the [issues](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/31202) I listed in last weeks blog concerns core language documentation, which I think would be a great starting point for our contributing.  I've been combing through further documentation issues (like the [following](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/31232)) as well as those marked with "good first issue tags."  Our hope is to identify a few more possible issues (including some that may be in corollary packages and libraries), and then from there make a decision on what to work on.

This week in class we were visited by Patrick Masson, the General Manager and Director for the Open Source Initiative.  Unfortunately I was unable to be there for his talk, but luckily Patrick provided a set of slides filled with general informaiton on OSI and open source development that I got the chance to review.  It is really encouraging to see all the ways in which open source is used in industry and the growing importance many companies place on open source participation.

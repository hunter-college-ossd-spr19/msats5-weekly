### Preparing to Contribute

For this week's post, we have been asked to think about what things we feel we need to learn the most in order to succesfully contribute to an open source project.  My immediate answer to this question is that there is no limit to what I need to learn in order to contribute, as I feel that every aspect of my programming skills could be improved upon.  I realize, though, that this reaction is due in large part to a lack of confidence, and that I do in fact have skills that would allow me to contribute meaningfully to a project.  I may be far from a flawless developer, but one of the most important aspects of open source development is the opportunity it affords particpants to learn and to sharpen their skills.  So, I suppose the first thing I would like to work on is my confidence and self doubt!

In terms of concrete skills I would like to work on, contributing to an open source project will be my first exposure to working within a strict development regimen (software testing, rigorous documentation, etc.).  There are a number of technologies that I have found many projects making use of (DOxygen for documentation, Travis CI for building and testing, CMake for buliding from source, and so forth) that I have not worked with before.  I would like to get familiar with these packages so that once I begin contributing I am comfortable making use of them.

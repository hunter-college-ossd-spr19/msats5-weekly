Hey there!

My name is Michael, and I am a (super) senior studying computer science at Hunter College.  After a brief foray studying music at a conservatory followed by a number of years working at coffee shops, I decided to go back to school in 2014, wrote my first line of code in an introductory CS class in 2015, and have been hooked ever since.  

This blog is being kept as part of a class on Open Source software development.  Weekly posts will be added regarding the materials we cover in class and project contributions made outside of it.
